===========

Frontend for the SportIM sports management app.

Node and npm are required for development, global npm installs are shown below but you may install locally as well.

To install dependencies, run:
```
npm install
```

Run with any static file server, but to use http-server:
```
npm start
```

Unit tests are run with jasmine and karma: 
```
npm test
```
These tests are configured to run within PhantomJS, however you may also use chrome or any other browser with a karma launcher for that browser.

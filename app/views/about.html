                <div class="sportim-logo inline-logo">Sport<span>IM</span></div> is an open source sport statistics tracking system with integrated player, team and league management. By providing a plugin-based statistics tracking method, SportIM fills a long-lived gap in the amateur sports landscape. It allows for scheduling matches, practices, and tournaments and sending alerts to remind participants of these events. Additionally, team coaches and league administrators can track their players' and teams' progress throughout the season through intuitive statistics collection interfaces. With these features, SportIM provides a much-needed pairing of sports team management with quantitative measurements of team progress.</font>
